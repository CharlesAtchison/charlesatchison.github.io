<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Here are just a few of the technologies and programming langauges I've worked with, in no particular order:</p>

<section>

<div class ="image-gallery">
    {% assign sorted = site.images.about_icons %}
    {% for file in sorted %}
    {% if file.path contains include.folder %}
        {% assign filenameparts = file.path | split: "/" %}
        {% assign filename = filenameparts | last | replace: file.extname,"" %}
            <div class="box"><a href="{{ file.path | relative_url }}" title="{{ filename }}">
            <img src="{{ site.imagesurl }}{{file.name }} " alt="{{ filename }}"  class="img-gallery" />
            </a></div>
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    </div>
