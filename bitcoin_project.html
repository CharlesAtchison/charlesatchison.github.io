                            <p>Using time-series analysis, historical data of Bitcoin prices were collected, cleaned, and analyzed. Various models, including Last Observed Value, Holt's Linear Trend, and others, were trained to predict future prices. Model performance was evaluated against a baseline prediction using metrics such as Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD).</p>

                            <h3 id="baseline-model">Baseline Model</h3>
                            <p>Before diving into complex models, a simple baseline prediction was established to provide a reference point. The mean or the last observed value can often be used as a straightforward baseline.</p>

                            <p>This approach, commonly known as the naive forecast, involves predicting the next data point based on the last observed value. It serves as a foundational model to benchmark other sophisticated models against.</p>

                            <p>The rolling and moving average method involves calculating the average of the data points within a specified window of time. This smoothing technique helps in identifying underlying trends by dampening short-term fluctuations and anomalies.</p>

                            <p>Each model's performance was gauged using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). By juxtaposing these metrics across models, the most optimal model was identified for forecasting Bitcoin prices.</p>
